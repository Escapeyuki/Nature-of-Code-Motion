/*
I basically went through the first few coding train videos and followed the tutorials on using the perlin noise.
On top of the coding train's code, I changed a few things
  change the opacity of the background, creating a trail effect
  added an effect where the rectangle will turn red and make random moves when the mouse is close

Overall just experiementing with perlin noise and similar concepts.
The effect is quite nice

Thinking about how I can implement perlin noise in future projects.
